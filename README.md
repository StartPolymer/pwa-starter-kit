# PWA Starter Kit Plus

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:

* all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
* a responsive layout
* application theming
* example of using Redux for state management
* offline UI
* simple routing solution
* fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern
* easy deployment to prpl-server or static hosting
* unit and integrating testing starting points
* documentation about other advanced patterns.

## New features

* [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) for define consistent coding styles between different editors. Atom and VS Code need to install a plugin.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is linting utility for JavaScript.
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is an opinionated code formatter for enforces a consistent style.

## Known issues

These are high priority and currently being worked on, and they will all be fixed before the 1.0 release:

* lit-element and lit-html have IE11 compatibility issues
* if you have node version 10, you might have problems running the unit tests (and you will get an error along the lines of `Cannot read property '1' of null`. For now, we recommend using node 8 or 9.

## TODOs

* [x] setup Safari testing on Travis
* [ ] update to latest [material-design-web-components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components)
* [x] deploy all templates as demos
